üîå API Endpoints Used
This project uses a mock API for demonstration purposes, provided by JSONPlaceholder.

Fetch Orders Data:

GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?_limit=50

This endpoint retrieves a list of "todo" items, which are then transformed and displayed as "Recent Orders" in the dashboard.

üìù Design Choices & Notes
Responsive Layout: The main layout was refactored from a simple grid to a more robust structure with a dedicated <Header /> component. This solved a major responsive issue where the header would appear in the middle of the page on mobile, ensuring a correct and intuitive layout on all devices.

Tailwind CSS Dark Mode: The project uses Tailwind's class strategy for dark mode, controlled by JavaScript. This allows the theme to be toggled manually and persisted in localStorage.

Table to Card Layout: On mobile screens, the traditional <table> for "Recent Orders" is replaced by a more readable card-based list. This is achieved using Tailwind's responsive utility classes (sm:hidden, hidden sm:block) to render the appropriate layout for the screen size.
